        <h2> Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mark Muturi and I'm a software enthusiast(or maybe addict :)).
            I am a student at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology(JKUAT) currently pursuing a degree in Business Innovation.
            I am also a Software Engineering Student at ALX which is a subsidiary of the African Leadership University (ALU), a world-reknown university with sister campuses in Mauritius and Rwanda and hubs in a number of other African countries.
            I have a range of hobbies and interests that are pretty diverse. I enjoy reading books, both fictional and educational, I am an avid motorsports fan(Formula 1 and Rally Racing), watching football, coding, art, listening to music and I LOVE cars!
            I always knew programming was my passion ever since I encountered code for the first time in 2020 and ALX has been key in my development in these skills as they have shown me that my dream to become a top software engineeer in the tech industry is achievable.
            I would like to apply the skills I have learnt and those that I am yet to learn to making change in my community and the world as a whole.
            I believe that this next generation has the ability to make or break the society and I would like to be a positive force for change to ensure that we eliminate all factors that make life unbearable and leave a better world for future generations.
            I realize that this seems like an impossible task but you have to aim for the stars in order to reach the moon. </p>
